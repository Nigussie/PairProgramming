Problem B
=========

Today's problem is going to be to try to solve the "FizzBuzz" problem.

The rules are:

* You have to count up from 1 up to an integer n (for now, let's say
n = 100). 
* If the number you say is divisible by 3, you say "Fizz" instead of the number.
* If the number is divisible by 5, you say "Buzz" instead of the number.
* And if the number is divisible by both 3 & 5, you say "FizzBuzz". 

Hint: The % (modulo) operator shows the remainder after a division, and it is pretty useful in this case. 
It can help you work out if something is divisible by another number (if the remainder is zero)
